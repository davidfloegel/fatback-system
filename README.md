# The Fatback System

The Fatback System by Gary Chaffee is an excellent concept for drummers to develop superlative bass drum control and freedom while playing a static backbeat.

It combines over 200 bass drum combinations with a static backbeat on 2 and 4, with a 1/4 to 1/16 rate in a 4/4 time signature.


## About the App

This app is a version 2 of the initial app I built back in 2015 which was using PhoneGap.
Now this app is written in React-Native which makes it native to both iOS and Android.


## Features

Here's a quick overview of features

- Generate 4/4 Grooves using random HiHat and Kick Drum patterns
- Change subdivision to triplets
- Three modes: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Accented HiHat notes


## Future Ideas

- [ ] Playback Grooves
- [ ] Different Time Signatures
- [ ] Add Ghost Notes
- [ ] Sync 2 devices via Bluetooth (1 for Bass, 1 for Drums)
